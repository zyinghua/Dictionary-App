# DictionaryApp
A dictionary app which clients interact with a central server for CRUD words.

To run the application, in out/artifacts, there are two jar folders:

out/artifacts/DictionaryServer_jar: run cmd: java -jar DictionaryServer.jar <ip address> <port no.> (note: default ip address is 'localhost')
  
out/artifacts/DictionaryClient_jar: run cmd: java -jar DictionaryClient.jar <ip address> <port no.> <open GUI? 0-no, 1-yes> (note: the ip address and port no. are the manager's who runs CreateWhiteboard.jar before this command)
